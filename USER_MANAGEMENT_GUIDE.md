# User Management System - Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ COMPLETED: User Management Interface

Your childcare management platform now has a complete user management system that allows MASTER users to control access.

### 🚀 **Access Your User Management**
1. Go to your dashboard: `http://localhost:3002`
2. Click **"User Management"** in the sidebar
3. You'll see the admin interface with current users

### 👥 **Current Demo Users**
- **Sarah Johnson** (MASTER) - Full access to everything
- **Emma Wilson** (ADMIN) - Access to 3 centres with editing rights  
- **Mike Chen** (USER) - View-only access to 2 centres
- **Lisa Brown** (USER) - Inactive user (can be reactivated)

### 🔧 **How to Manage Users as a MASTER**

#### **Add New User:**
1. Click "Add New User" button
2. Fill in: Name, Email, Role, and Centres
3. Choose role:
   - **MASTER**: Can manage all users + full access
   - **ADMIN**: Multiple centres, specific permissions
   - **USER**: Limited centre access

#### **Control Existing Users:**
- **Edit**: Click pencil icon to modify permissions
- **Deactivate**: Click eye-off icon to remove access (user leaves company)
- **Reactivate**: Click eye icon to restore access

### 🏢 **Real-World Example Usage**
